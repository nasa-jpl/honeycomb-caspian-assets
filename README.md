# honeycomb-caspian-assets

This repository contains data mainly for the Honeycomb Caspian standalone app at https://github.com/nasa-jpl/honeycomb.

## M2020 Sol 122
See:
- `configs/json/2021-06-25-20-14-48_sol00122.json`
- `data/sol00122`

This dataset is for visualizing the Mars Perseverance rover from sol 122.
Specifically, it includes kinematic data of the rover position and its robotic joints (in the .rksml file); stereo images (.jpeg files); and height and cost maps (as defined in the .arksml file, and the .bin files).
The data is meant to be used as an example of how the Honeycomb tool visualizes Mars Perseverance rover robotic data.

This dataset was retrieved by the following members of the RSVP team at JPL: Benjamin Nuernberger, Andrei Tumbar, Steven Myint, Amanda Chung, and Jeng Yen. All authors are from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology.

The research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (80NM0018D0004).
